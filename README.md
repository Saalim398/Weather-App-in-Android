# Weather-App-in-Android
`Weather INFO`
version `1.0`   

I have developed an intermediate Android weather application "Weather Info" that retrieves data from the OpenWeatherMap using its API.      

## Features   

This software displays the current temperature and the weather forecast with an icon. It obtains data as a JSON object via an API.  
It displays pressure and humidity as well.  
I downloaded and obtained the image in real time using the openweathermap weather icon on my Android device by utilising the Picasso library.   

This is the app's image.
